# 🚚 Supply Chain Cost Simulator

Supply chains don’t exist in a vacuum — they react to fuel prices, tariffs, and exchange rates every day.  
This interactive Streamlit app lets you *play with those variables* and instantly see how they affect total costs.  

I built it as a teaching and exploration tool for logistics planners, trade analysts, and students of international economics.  
It’s a simple way to visualize how global shocks ripple through supply chains.
